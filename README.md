# SEMrush Webinar

Hello, Internet traveller. 

Here you will find resources related to the SEMrush webinar (3/5/20):
**Scaling Ranking Data Analysis: organizing, visualizing, and having some fun with SEMrush data** part of the
<a href="https://www.semrush.com/webinars/5-hours-of-seo-or-7-sessions-back-to-back/">5 hours of SEO</a> webinar series.

## Session Summary
We donâ€™t always have access to first-party data (ðŸ˜”), buuuut luckily, we can use third-party data to develop our understanding and help derive directional business intelligence and insights (ðŸ˜Š).

During the session, we are going to spend 15 minutes going through one method of gleaning insights from a large-scale ranking dataset. Using SEMrushâ€™s organic ranking report* (our sizeable third-party dataset for today), weâ€™re going to:

Segment keywords into different subsets using a Jupyter Notebook (including brand/non-brand, SERP intent, intents, question words, etc.),
Load the data into Power Bi*,
Visualize some data to support identifying insights.
If you love content, ranking analyses, or are passionate about efficiencies in reporting, youâ€™re going to enjoy the fifth session of 5 Hours of SEO with Alexis Sanders!

*Note: regardless of your toolset (for ranking and BI visualization), this methodology can help you identify insights.

This thirty-minute session is hosted by Nik Ranger.
